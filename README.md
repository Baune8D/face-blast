Small game written in Java while I went to school in 2012.

### Controls

Move character around with the keyboard arrows.  
Shoot with ```A``` ```S``` ```D``` ```W```

### Note

The game should be runnable without any adjustments.  
Highscore functionality does not work out of the box as it needs a third party dependency and an actual live database.
